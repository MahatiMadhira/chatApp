# Full Stack Chat App using React, NodeJS, Express and chatEngine.io to host and store chat data

A fully functional chat application that supports:
- multiple users
- group chats
- read reciepts
- image and file sharing
- User authentication
- socket connections, etc.

# Main packages used to build chat app:

- express HTTP server framework
- cors to process requests from other hosts (for our ReactJS app)
- axios to send HTTP requests to other servers (for Chat Engine APIs)
- nodemon to run the server in dev-mode
- [react-chat-engine-pretty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chat-engine-pretty) (pre-build UI)
